This is a basic java dice game, no GUI.
This is designed as a short "yahtzee" game, where each roll adds to the total sum. The one who earns the higher total is the winner.
Each set is composed of five rounds; player vs. computer
*Note: This project uses the Scanner and Random package. If you'll be running this on an online IDE, the codes will only run in the ones that supports BOTH packages.
